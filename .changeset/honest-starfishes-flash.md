Add `customApi` to `ResolveOptions` to allow for a custom `ApiPromise` instance, instead of creating a new default one. This approach is way more performant and memory efficient, if you have an already existing `ApiPromise` anyways. â€“ Make sure to always initialize the chain and rpc correctly, though.
