This repository contains JS/TS libraries to resolve domains & addresses registered with [AZERO.ID](https://azero.id).

It's built as a monorepo and contains the following packages:

- `@azns/resolver-core` ‚Äì Vanilla JS/TS Library
- `@azns/resolver-react` ‚Äì React-Hooks Library (depends on `@azns/resolver-core`)

Additionally, multiple working examples are provided for both packages.

üìÉ **Integration Guide:** https://docs.azero.id/integration

üë©‚Äçüíª **Interface Documentation:** https://azero-id.github.io/resolver/

## Testnet Disclaimer üö®

Currently, this package is not production-ready and only works on the [Aleph Zero Testnet](https://testnet.alephzero.org/). Aleph Zero Mainnet contract addresses are provided as soon as our contracts are deployed there.

## Getting Started

### Vanilla JS/TS

Install the package from the npm registry:

```bash
npm install @azns/resolver-core
# or
pnpm add @azns/resolver-core
# or
yarn add @azns/resolver-core
```

Resolve domain ‚Üí address via [`resolveDomainToAddress`](https://azero-id.github.io/resolver/functions/_azns_resolver_core.resolveDomainToAddress.html):

```ts
import { SupportedChainId, resolveDomainToAddress } from '@azns/resolver-core'

const address = await resolveDomainToAddress('domains.tzero', {
  chainId: SupportedChainId.AlephZeroTestnet,
})
```

Resolve address ‚Üí primary domain(s) via [`resolveAddressToDomain`](https://azero-id.github.io/resolver/functions/_azns_resolver_core.resolveAddressToDomain.html):

```ts
import { SupportedChainId, resolveAddressToDomain } from '@azns/resolver-core'

const primaryDomains = await resolveAddressToDomain(
  '5GgzS1G34d2wRxtVBnSkA8GQBj4ySnGqQb34ix2ULwVzKdWQ',
  {
    chainId: SupportedChainId.AlephZeroTestnet,
  },
)
```

### React/Next.js Hooks

Install the packages from the npm registry:

```bash
npm install @azns/resolver-core @azns/resolver-react
# or
pnpm add @azns/resolver-core @azns/resolver-react
# or
yarn add @azns/resolver-core @azns/resolver-react
```

Resolve domain ‚Üí address via [`useResolveDomainToAddress`](https://azero-id.github.io/resolver/functions/_azns_resolver_react.useResolveDomainToAddress.html):

```ts
import { SupportedChainId } from '@azns/resolver-core'
import { useResolveDomainToAddress } from '@azns/resolver-react'

const { address } = useResolveDomainToAddress('domains.tzero', {
  chainId: SupportedChainId.AlephZeroTestnet,
})
```

Resolve address ‚Üí primary domain(s) via [`useResolveAddressToDomain`](https://azero-id.github.io/resolver/functions/_azns_resolver_react.useResolveAddressToDomain.html):

```ts
import { SupportedChainId } from '@azns/resolver-core'
import { useResolveAddressToDomain } from '@azns/resolver-react'

const { primaryDomain } = useResolveAddressToDomain(
  '5GgzS1G34d2wRxtVBnSkA8GQBj4ySnGqQb34ix2ULwVzKdWQ',
  {
    chainId: SupportedChainId.AlephZeroTestnet,
  },
)
```
