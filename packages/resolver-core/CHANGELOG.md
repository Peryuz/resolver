# @azns/resolver-core

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/pull/33) [`6c5c1d1`](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/commit/6c5c1d1801295a7e3e36b87db08ec35d3b4298f1) Thanks [@wottpal](https://github.com/wottpal)! - Adds domain sanitization to `resolveDomainToAddress` which means, by default, domains get trimmed & lowercased before resolving now. The behavior can be disabled by passing `skipSanitization: true`. Also, the `sanitizeDomain` utility function was added and gets exported separately.

- [#34](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/pull/34) [`e672363`](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/commit/e6723631a398d45bb8be0e72b793406cb724491d) Thanks [@wottpal](https://github.com/wottpal)! - Cache `ContractPromise` object for `azns_router` contract via new `getRouterContract` helper.

### Minor Changes

- [`4beafea`](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/commit/4beafea400fd76d284755d9ba698f9c6cbb899e1) Thanks [@wottpal](https://github.com/wottpal)! - When resolving an address, check its format beforehand and add custom error `INVALID_ADDRESS_FORMAT` for invalid SS58 address formats.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/pull/13) [`31acda3`](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/commit/31acda37409cdd945fa12669bac364e3eb312990) Thanks [@wottpal](https://github.com/wottpal)! - Add `customApi` to `ResolveOptions` to allow for a custom `ApiPromise` instance, instead of creating a new default one. This approach is way more performant and memory efficient, if you have an already existing `ApiPromise` anyways. â€“ Make sure to always initialize the chain and rpc correctly, though.
